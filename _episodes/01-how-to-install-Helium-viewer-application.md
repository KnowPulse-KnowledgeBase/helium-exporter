## Download and install Helium Pedigree Visualization Framework

To visualize pedigree and categorical data generated by Helium Data Exporter, you will first need to install Helium Pedigree Visualization Application on your local computer. Helium Data Exporter interface contains a graphical setup guide to assist
you through the process of installing Helium (short for Helium Pedigree Visualization Application). In addition, all pertinent links to get you started are also outlined in the guide, including links to download a Helium version that is compatible to your operating system (OS) in use.


Please note for Mac OS user that your system will notify you upon installation about potential safety issue since Helium is not obtained through Apple store. This can be bypassed by pressing CTR key when clicking Open button (install) when prompted.
