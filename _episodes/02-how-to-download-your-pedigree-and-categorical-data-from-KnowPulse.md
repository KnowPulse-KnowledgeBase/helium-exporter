## How to download your pedigree and categorical data 

Pedigree and categorical data from you registered experiment(s) can be downloaded from Helium Exporter module (missing link)(requires log in to access).


1. Select an experiment of your interest from the **Experiment** selector. You have to be one of the users of an experiment before you can access the data under it. 
2. The next section is the **Germplasm/lines selector with search functionality**.  In this section, on your left hand side, there is a germplasm field button. In the screenshot for example, there are ### germplasm available for you to view. On your right hand side, in the field control, you can either use **Search** to look for a specific germplasm from the field, or click on **All** to select all the available germplasm. 

3. Followed by the germplasm section, it is the the **Trait/categorical data selector with search functionality**. Again, on your left hand side, there is a trait search field button. From the screenshot example, there are ### traits available for your to view. On your right hand side, in the field control, you can either use **Search** to look for a specific trait from the field, or click on **All** to select all the available traits.
